# ✈️ Aviation Risk Analysis – Phase 1 Project

This project uses aviation accident data from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) to analyze and visualize aircraft risks. The goal is to provide actionable insights to help a company safely and strategically enter the aviation industry.

## 📌 Project Objective

To help a company evaluate which aircraft types are the lowest risk for investment by analyzing accident patterns, severity, locations, and environmental conditions from 1962–2023.

## 📂 Dataset

- **Source:** National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)
- **Format:** CSV
- **Period Covered:** 1962–2023
- **Key Features:**
  - Aircraft Make & Model
  - Injury Severity
  - Weather Conditions
  - Accident Locations
  - Flight Phase

---

## 🧠 Business Questions

1. **Which aircraft makes and models have the most accidents?**
2. **What are the common causes of fatal injuries in aviation accidents?**
3. **Which states and weather conditions are most associated with fatal accidents?**

---

## 📊 Tools & Technologies

- **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Colab (Google Colaboratory)**
- Optional: Power BI or Plotly Dash for future dashboards

---

## 📈 Key Findings

- **Top Risky Models:** Aircraft from Cessna, Piper, and Beech show high accident frequencies.
- **Phases of Risk:** Fatalities are highest during takeoff and landing.
- **Location & Conditions:** States like CA, TX, and AK have the most fatal accidents, often in visual weather—indicating human error more than environmental challenges.

---

## ✅ Recommendations

1. **Aircraft Selection:** Avoid high-incident aircraft without updated safety reviews.
2. **Pilot Training:** Focus on takeoff and landing simulations and recurrent training.
3. **Location Strategy:** Begin in lower-risk U.S. states and enforce strict weather protocols.
